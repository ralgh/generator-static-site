Yeoman currently pulls in a specific, stable SHA of the generators repo which is used during installation.If you wish to update your local clone of Yeoman to use a more recent SHA of whats in master on the Generators repo, this can be done in the main yeoman/cli/package.json file under the dependencies section.

Developers making changes to Generators that they wish to test can follow this process alternatively:

* Go to your local clone of Yeoman and find the node_modules directory in the CLI. This is where we've installed your local dependencies, including one called 'yeoman-generators'. 
* Apply the changes you wish to make to a Generator, including adding new Generators to yeoman-generators/lib. This can be either changes you wish to later apply to your fork of yeoman/generators or just something already in your fork which you wish to actually test.
* Changes should automatically be available for testing, however, if for any reason this isn't the case, you can manually re-install yeoman via yeoman/cli and `sudo npm install -g` followed by `sudo npm link`.
