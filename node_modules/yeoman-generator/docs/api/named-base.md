### NamedBase

The `NamedBase` object is only dealing with one argument: `name`.

You can use it whenever you need at least one **required** positional
argument for your generator (which is a fairly common use case)

- args - A String or Array of arguments to init the generator with.
- opts - A Hash of options to init the generator with.
