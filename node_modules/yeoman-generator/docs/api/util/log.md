### log

`this.log` is a [logref](https://github.com/mikeal/logref)
compatible logger, with a bit of enhanced API.

It also have EventEmitter like ability, so you can call on / emit
on it, namely used to increase or decrease the padding.

All logs are done against STDERR, letting you stdout for meaningfull
value and redirection, should you need to generate output this way.

Log functions take two arguments, a message and a context. For any
other kind of paramters, `console.error` is used, so all of the
console format string goodies you're used to work fine.

- msg      - The message to show up
- context  - The optional context to escape the message against

Retunrns the logger

### log#write

A simple write method, with formatted message. If `msg` is
ommitted, then a single `\n` is written.

Returns the logger

### log#writeln

Same as `log.write()` but automatically appends a `\n` at the end
of the message.

### log#ok

Convenience helper to write sucess status, this simply prepends the
message with a gren `âœ”`.

### log#status

Each predefined status has its logging method utility, handling
status color and padding before the usual `.write()`

Example

    this.log
      .write()
      .info('Doing something')
      .force('Forcing filepath %s, 'some path')
      .conflict('on %s' 'model.js')
      .write()
      .ok('This is ok');

The list of status and mapping colors

    skip       yellow
    force      yellow
    create     green
    invoke     bold
    conflict   red
    identical  cyan
    info       grey

Returns the logger

### log#table

A basic wrapper around `cli-table` package, resetting any single
char to empty strings, this is used for aligning options and
arguments without too much Math on our side.

- opts - A list of rows or an Hash of options to pass through cli
          table.

Returns the table reprensetation
